# SIMPLE KEYLOGGER
A keylogger is a program designed to record every keystroke made by a user on a computer. While keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity or recovering lost data, they are often associated with malicious activities like stealing sensitive information. 

# HOW IT WORK'S
1.IMPORTING LIBRARY
    The pynput.keyboard module is imported to listen to keyboard events.
2.on_press FUNCTION
  This function is called every time a key is pressed. It logs the key to a file named keylog.txt.For regular keys, it logs the character.For special keys (like shift, ctrl), it logs the key name.
3.on_release FUNCTION
  This function checks if the esc key is pressed and stops the listener if it is.
4.LISTENER SETUP
  The keyboard.Listener is initialized with the on_press and on_release functions and started with listener.join().

# ETHICAL CONSIDERATION
  Legal Issues: Implementing and using keyloggers without consent is illegal in many jurisdictions. They can capture sensitive information, leading to severe privacy violations.
  Ethical Issues: Using keyloggers without informing the user violates ethical standards and trust

# ALTERNATIVE USE
  Educational Purposes: Understanding how keyloggers work can help in learning about security and developing countermeasures.
  Security Audits: In controlled environments with consent, keyloggers can be used to audit security practices and improve them.
